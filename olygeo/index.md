# Configuration Handouts



**The goal of this series** is to help familiarize you with the most common geometric configurations and the supporting theory behind them. Because some olympiad geometry problems break down into some of the following configurations, it is useful to recognize these patterns as they can motivate constructions on similar problems. 

**How to use these handouts:** It is recommended to all readers to use these handouts only as supplements to your other studies. Do not memorize these "facts"; the practical benefits come from (1) understanding the interconnected nature of these properties and (2) recognizing these configurations in different contexts. For the former, you must try to prove these properties yourself. For the latter, doing practice problems is still the most effective way to improve.

**Contributing:** If you have corrections, problems to add, or suggestions in general, don't hesitate to reach out to me via AoPS (dragon96) or email.
