This IAP, I took an experimental neuroscience class that tried to review the literature about memory systems. A theme that recurred throughout the class is that there is very little experimental data to work off of, and even when there are empirical results, it is difficult to reach a consensus on the interpretation of its results. 

Below are the readings we did and short summaries of each one. Each week's batch of papers represents a collection of differing (and often conflicting) perspectives on memory systems. I marked with (\*\*) for papers I found especially interesting. The original course landing page can be found [here](https://cbmm.mit.edu/education/courses/memory-wars-contrasting-views-memory-systems-neuroscience-research).

#### Week 0: Neuroscience Philosophy

* [[Krakauer2017]](http://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)31040-6.pdf): Neurosciencists need to use **behavioral** studies to motivate the hypotheses, and correct its strong reductionist approach in the field. The paper provides four examples of experiments well-conducted that fit this model.

#### Week 1: Memory Representation

* [[BuzsakiMoser2013]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week2_BuzsakiMoser2013.pdf): Views memory as a feature that evolved from navigation tasks. Two ways of navigating are egocentric/path-integration methods (self-referenced) and allocentric (map-based) methods. The former corresponds to episodic memory while the latter corresponds to semantic memory. In contrast to Eichenbaum, a strong focus is placed on **spatial representation**. Supposedly the leading view on memory models. 
* [[Eichenbaum2017]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week2_Eichenbaum2017.pdf): Takes a similar stance as Buzsaki and Moser, in that the hippocampus' role in navigation is memory. However, it takes the stance that the hippocampus is not dedicated to spatial navigation, but rather in **relational organization**.
* [[Gross2002]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week2_Gross_2002.pdf): The idea of **grandmother cells**, a hypothetical neuron that responds to highly specialized stimuli, such as your grandmother's face.
* [[Tonegawa2015]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week2_Tonegawa2015.pdf): Reviews the contemporary stance of **memory engrams**, which are defined to be physical and chemical changes that arise from a newly formed memory association, and is sometimes used interchangeably with "memory trace". Memories are somehow represented in **ensembles** of engram cells. Memory formation is intrinsically related to learning processes.  
* [[Gaffan2002]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week2_Gaffan2002.pdf) The concept of memory systems is harmful. In particular, there is evidence to support that memory systems are not localized to the temporal lobe, and that because of general plasticity rules, the prefrontal cortex and other cortical regions could be involved in the storage of memory traces. 

#### Week 2: Memory Consolidation

* [[ \*\*Moscovitch2016, pg. 11-16]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060006/pdf/nihms819281.pdf): There are two camps on how memory consolidation works. **Standard consolidation theory** argues that the hippocampus serves as a temporary memory structure until memories are consolidated elsewhere, presumably the neocortex. **Multiple trace theory** (proposed by Moscovitch) argues that the memory representation determines the brain structure that mediates it. From studies on patients with retrograde amnesia, there is evidence to believe that more detailed autobiographical memories trace back to the hippocampus while gist-like/semantic memories only engage the neocortex. They propose that the hippocampus binds together local and global contextual information about an environment, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex binds together whatever is similar across events.
* [[Squire2015]](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Week3_Squire2015.pdf) A proponent of the standard systems consolidation theory. Support comes from studies about **retroactive interference** and brain lesions.
* [[ \*\*O-Reilly2014]](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01214.x/epdf): Offers a theory of **complementary learning systems** to explain **catastrophic interference**, in which subsequent learning overwrites earlier learning. The hippocampus is responsible for sparse, non-overlapping representations that are robust to inteference, while other cortical areas maintain strongly-overlapping representations. There are advantages to both systems; sparse representations are able to faithfully recreate the cortical activity representing a memory, making recollections unlikely to be inaccurate. Overlapping representations are presumably able to generalize more readily across different scenarios.  
* [[ \*\*RichardsFrankland2017]](http://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(17)30365-3.pdf): Takes an ontological perspective that **transience** (forgetting), and not just **persistence** (remembering), are necessary features for a robust memory system. Transience promotes behavioral flexibility and generalization, while persistence is only useful when there are relatively stable components of an experience. On the neurobiological level, (i) AMPA receptor endocytosis is linked with short-term transience and (ii) hippocampal neurogenesis regulates transcience by inducing instability.
