# What did I learn today?

I spent an afternoon in building 2 reading Ch. 3 of Strogatz about bifurcations.  

There is a technique called **dimensionless scaling**. For example, you can change the time scale of a problem. The time scale at which you look at things makes a difference when looking at terms asymptotically, as it can change whether a term is considered "negligible" or not.

A simple mechanics problem is actually a second order differential equation, even though we often model them as a first order differential equation. When is it valid to drop the second order term? Well, if you look at the behavior of the system including the second order term, while considering that the coefficient in front of the second order term is quite small, you observe behavior in which there is a thin "layer" of time of the system converging into the approximated first order system. 

**The three bifurcations**, their intuitions, and normal forms:
* Saddle-node: The appearance and disappearance of fixed points: $x' = r - x^2$
* Transcritical: The stability of a fixed point bifurcates: $x' = rx - x^2$
* Pitchfork: The appearance and disappearance of symmetric fixed points: $x' = rx - x^3$

My understanding for difference between saddle-node and pitchfork is even vs. odd-ness of the function.

Studying with VA in building 2 was quite an elucidating experience. 

I feel unsatisfied with just reading papers/textbooks sometimes, because this feels like a very passive approach to learning. VA is more often scribbling something on a paper than just reading. 

Another observation is that he wastes very little idle time. At Koreana, he pulled out his phone to read some lecture notes on Bayes. On the T to dinner, he pulled out proofs from the book to read. When I think about the time allotment throughout the day, a lot of it sinks into idle time, or time when I get sucked into thinking about something and become paralyzed with inaction.
