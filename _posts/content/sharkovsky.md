I recently started doing some reading about Sharkovsky's Theorem. The statement of the theorem is as follows:

>Order the positive integers: 
\\[ 3, 5, 7, 9, \cdots, (2k+1), \cdots \\]
\\[ 6, 10, 14, 18, \cdots, 2(2k+1), \cdots \\]
\\[ 12, 20, 28, 36, \cdots, 2^2(2k+1), \cdots \\]
\\[ \vdots \\]
\\[ \cdots, 2^k, \cdots, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 \\]
If $f$ is a continuous function on an interval $I$ such that it has a point with period $m$, then it has a point with period $n$ for any $n$ coming after $m$. (A point $x$ is periodic with period $m$ if $f^m(x) = x$.)

A special case of this theorem is Yorke's "Period 3 implies Chaos", which covers $m=3$. Yorke's result also states that period $m=3$ also implies that there are uncountably infinite points that have very irregular behavior under repeated transformations of $f$.

The main ideas behind the proofs are quite accessible, although the specific constructions for the general case are a bit hacky. See [1] and [2].
