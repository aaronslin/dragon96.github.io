Last week there was a pretty major Congressional hearing involving the four CEOs of Google (Pichai),
Apple (Cook), Amazon (Bezos), and Facebook (Zuckerberg). This was a pretty historic hearing given
the size that big tech companies have grown to and considering the government's relatively minimal
involvement in the 21st century in keeping them in check. The full testimony runs for 5-6 hours and
you can watch it at [1].

## Antitrust and Power

It may surprise you to hear that the toughest questions came from left field. In summary, from what 
I hear from the media's commentary after the hearing, House Republican committee members chose to
focus on anti-conservative bias rather than larger antitrust issues, fearing that they would
otherwise ideologically appear as anti-business and anti-free-market to their constituents.

> In an earlier era, Republicans and Democrats on the committee might have come together to try to
> focus on what’s been seen as an area of relative bipartisan agreement: protecting the free market.
> That didn’t happen at today’s hearing. Instead, it was a display of partisan divides.

Still, even if some of the questions from the right were poorly prepared or outright irrelevant to
antitrust, I think there is still a valid sentiment being expressed, reading between the lines:
power. What kind of power do big tech companies hold today, and how would we define it the 21st
century? There is no precedent in antitrust law on data collection, information policing, support of
foreign governments (i.e. China), and surveillance at today's scale. Thus, it is natural we have
reasons to fear big tech for practices beyond price-fixing and stifling competition.

## Notes on the hearing

Here were some of the most interesting lines of inquiry along with (sometimes approximate)
timestamps, a summary from the Congressmember's perspective, and the broader questions that arise:

### Platform Conflict of Interest

This is potentially the strongest case against big tech. Apple, Google, and Amazon all host
distribution platforms upon which third-party merchants are both partners/customers on the platform
as well as competitors with the companies' home products. How do we reconcile the dual role of 
big tech companies as market makers and merchants on their own platforms?

  * 1:51:12 Cicilline (Google): There is an inherent conflict of interest between Google Search's
    mission to display the most relevant content to users and monetizing off ads.
	* Pichai's response to search dominance was that, taking e-commerce as an example, most searches
	  originate on Amazon, so within search (depending on how you draw the lines), there is still
	  intense competition. The competition is exclusive to only the largest tech companies (duopoly).
  * 2:16:00 Johnson (Apple): Apple is the sole decision maker for whether third-party apps can be 
    sold on the App Store. Furthermore, all payments must go through Apple Pay.
	* In response to the question about what prevents Apple from raising commissions, Cook's response is
	  that there is still fierce competition with Android and MS developers. Still another duopoly
	  situation.
  * 2:53:40 Jayapal (Amazon): Amazon uses costomers' third-party data to compete with sellers on its
    own platforms.
  * 3:33:45 Cicilline (Amazon): It is anti-competitive and conflict-of-interest when third party
    sellers compete against the platform that sets the rules.
  * 3:53:54 Raskin (Amazon): Amazon is selling Echos below production cost to gain market position 
    on smart home devices, where it can better promote its own products like Prime Music and Amazon
	Basics.
	* Q: At face value, it seems like there's an inherent conflict of interest owning a brand and
	  selling it on your own platform How would Amazon's own brand (Amazon Basics) be any different
	  from Walmart or CVS branded items? 
  * 6:03:30 Jayapal (Google, Facebook): Google dominates both buy-side and sell-side bidding of ad 
    space. Independent journalism is dying because they are deprived of ad revenue.
	* Interesting comment on insider trading.

### Defining market power

Antitrust law takes for granted the premise of "market power" being well-defined (or perhaps,
maybe it's only clear in retrospect). Where do we draw the boundaries of a product market to
understand market dominance?

  * 3:16:04: Scanlon (Amazon): Amazon's acquisition of diapers.com drove up prices on diapers.
  	* Question: What makes the online diaper market separate from the general diaper market?
  * 5:06:50 Neguse (Amazon): The Amazon ecosystem is an innovation killzone, as Amazon uses 
    confidential AWS data from its customers to steal and replicate core technologies.
	* Question: What makes e-commerce a separate market from retail, if it is? Depending on how we
	  draw the lines on what a market is, we might be able to point to Amazon and declare them as
	  having market dominance.

### Defining a competitor for free services

  * 2:03:47 Nadler (Facebook): Mergers and acquisitions to neutralize competing companies is
    anticompetitive. 
    * From Zuckerberg's perspective, acquisition of Instagram would not have garnered the same
	  traction and succeeded had they not been acquired. Furthermore Facebook wasn't as big a
	  platform back then.
  * 3:22:00 Neguse (Facebook): Facebook's acquisition of Whatsapp, Instagram and the fact that 
    none of the 2004 social networks exist anymore proves the point that Facebook is a monopoly.
    * Q: Was AOL a competitor to FB? Both products are social networking platforms, which do not
	  directly generate revenue in themselves. In fact, many social networking platforms are
	  entirely free. How do we define a competitor in this landscape?

### Software Replicability

Unlike other industries, software is easily replicable and lacks a good boundary on intellectual
property. How do we make the case about monopolistic behavior when a tech giant can simply build
a clone of competing products? (e.g. Facebook stories and Snapchat)

  * 3:45:05 Jayapal (Facebook): Prior to Instagram's acquisition, Facebook threatened Instagram 
	into acquisition by building a clone of the product (Facebook Camera). It is monopolistic to
	Facebook to use its market dominance to copy and acquire competitors.

### Information and Data Dominance

  * Several questions were directed to Pichai, Bezos, Zuckerberg about using their data dominance to
    identify anti-competitive threats. The CEOs wrote this off as standard market research practice.
	Defining market power on data availability would be a novel concept in antitrust.
  * 2:29:00 Raskin (Facebook): Information hub, election interference, and how that qualifies for 
    antitrust.
  * 3:06:30 Demings (Google): Google gained enormous market power in the form of user data. Google
    acquires smaller companies to join (in an SQL sense) user data and cement its market power on
	user data.


## A Historical View of Antitrust in the U.S.

Antitrust law in the U.S. [2] start with the Sherman Antitrust law in 1890 and the Clayton Act of
1914 . These are still the foundations for antitrust law, even if there are parts that are outdated
in the modern world.

 > First, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits price-fixing and the operation of cartels, and
 > prohibits other collusive practices that unreasonably restrain trade. Second, Section 7 of the
 > Clayton Act restricts the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that would likely
 > substantially lessen competition. Third, Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits the abuse of
 > monopoly power.

There's quite a bit of debate on how to interpret and enforce antitrust laws. One view ("the Chicago
School") sees that antitrust laws should focus solely on monopolies' direct impacts on the consumer
(for example, price-fixing), and not necessarily on issues of broader public interest like
intellectual property, data protection, electioneering. I think this is an especially relevant
question to revisit today, seeing how big tech is a huge win for the end consumer from a pricing
standpoint. Google search, Gmail, Drive are all free to the consumer. Online retail is extremely
cheap because of Amazon's market power (potentially deriving from its anti-competitive pricing).
Not to say that this justifies the monopolizing presence of big tech companies, but it would be
difficult to argue for big tech's "badness" from this perspective.

Wendover Productions made a relevant video on why trains are so expensive and inefficient in the
U.S. [3], which gives a taste for arguments against this perspective. (On a somewhat tangential
note, it seems that there could be a pretty strong historical connection between the mediocrity of
the American train system and Sherman antitrust. Antitrust law seems to be targeted at the late
19th century dominance of the railroad industry, which was one of the first major American
industries crossing state boundaries, giving rise to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. I guess
what I'm trying to allude to is that given that these two laws were passed within a few years of
each other that antitrust law was likely conceived with interstate commerce as the new scary thing
to be wary of.)

## IBM, AT&T, and Microsoft

In the late 20th century, there were three major antitrust cases against U.S. technology companies:
IBM starting in the 70's, AT&T sometime in the early 80's, and Microsoft in the 90's. I thought it
would be interesting to read about these cases, as they're the cases that will likely have the most
relevant precedents.

One of the most interesting themes that seems arise from this sequence of lawsuits is that each one
creates a fertile ground for the next technological breakthrough to flourish. Microsoft was founded
upon the same software market IBM opened. Today's tech giants, represented by the Computer &
Communication Industry Association (CCIA), opposed AT&T's attempted 2011 purchase of T-Mobile.  
Antitrust cases in the U.S. are traditionally understood through horizontal and vertical mergers.

The hearings of today are neither of these; while the layers of software on more software on
hardware easily fits the "verticals" pattern, big tech's power doesn't all derive from
vertical *acquisitions*. First, many verticals are home grown in software world (I'm less familiar with
hardware, so I won't comment on that). The bigger moral issue is about gatekeeping the
markets created by each tech company's product. Google search creates a marketplace for ads, Amazon
for online retail, Apple's App Store for mobile apps, and Facebook products for the attention
economy. 

There is more historical precedent in successful antitrust hearings featuring anticompetitive behavior
horizontally, and there is still a good case to be made today about Amazon and the App Store.
However, I think there is a more interesting line of inquiry about the vertical business that
monopolies stifle, in which one company holds the cards for the services relying on its platform.

### United States vs. IBM

Starting with IBM, in summary this case was one of the lengthiest (13 years?) and biggest antitrust cases in
U.S. history, which was eventually dismissed by the Reagan administration as half of the products
that IBM had been called out on for monopolistic practices weren't even on the market anymore. From
the commentaries I read about this case, the main narrative about this case is that even if an
antitrust lawsuit goes nowhere, it could still be extremely costly and discourage the company from
monopolistic practices during the suit. 

One common thread between the IBM case and today's antitrust hearings are that the anti-monopolistic
practices that the companies can adopt actually disadvantage the end user:

> "Oddly, enough IBM was able to strengthen its antitrust-related legal position by reducing its
> market share, which it achieved through raising prices. When the suit was discontinued that share
> had fallen dramatically since 1969 from about 50 percent of the market to 37 percent in 1982. Only
> after the government suit ended did IBM lower its prices in order to increase market share."

That said, there are still a couple contextual differences between this week's hearings and IBM.
Remember that 1969 was pre-Internet [Note 1], so this is a case in which network effects
were likely less pronounced, unlike today's big tech issues that border on being a "natural
monopoly". Also, this came before the personal computing revolution, so this is about
the market share on mainframes sold to businesses, not personal computers for the common person.

The fear of monopolies had more to do with the unbundling of IBM hardware from the software it runs,
which had previously come free on its mainframes. Instead, software would be sold separately at
IBM's discretion, spawning a separate, massive software market. I didn't do the research here, but
this business decision was probably one of the main forces that set in motion the clear boundary
between hardware and software we have today. The idea of UNIX as an independent project from the
hardware it runs on, and the deal that Bill Gates later struck with IBM to come with MS-DOS on IBM
machines were due to this sales decision.

This interesting perspective comes from [4]. The theme of bundling and unbundling is still wildly 
pertinent in today's software ecosystem. Apple bundles homegrown apps with every iPhone, competing
with independently developed apps. Amazon sets Prime Video and Amazon Music as default apps
integrated with the Echo. Facebook's strategy of aggressively acquiring of other social networking
apps appears to be following in the footsteps of Chinese mega-apps, in which the messaging platform
becomes the next gateway or marketplace. (e.g. what Facebook tried to do with Internet.org). And
Google, well... you know. Another historical example of this, except more recent:

> "The first smartphone to disrupt the PC market was the Apple iPhone — an integrated solution. And
> once the technology became "good enough" to meet the average consumer’s needs, Google modularized
> everything except the operating system (Android) and the app store (Google Play)."

I think there are some interesting questions on this front of what a tech giant is allowed to bundle
and unbundle. To use Apple as an example, they bundle their home-grown apps and iOS with the phone
for software interoperability and hardware integration, but they also unbundle app development from
iOS via the App Store. My personal view is that there is some hypocrisy somewhere in here, in which
Apple profits from integration and positive network externalities and also regulates the platform
and market that it created for independent app development. This critique came up several times in
questions fielded towards both Cook on the App Store and Bezos on third-party sellers. (Now I'm
surprised Pichai didn't get the same questions on the Play Store.)

### United States v. AT&T

(This part I took some notes on in my readings, but don't have enough time to write it all up in
full.)

The AT&T case led to the breakup of AT&T into several regional companies, making a distinction
between local calls and long-distance calls. The parent AT&T company continued its business as an
interexchange carrier (IXC) post-breakup, but was forced to divest from its local exchange carriers
(LECs). In other words, a call that originates in one region destined for the same region doesn't
get handled by AT&T. However, a long-distance call from region A to B could be routed by three
carriers: first by the caller's LEC to AT&T's owned point of presence (POP) in A, then by AT&T from
A to B, and finally by the callee's LEC from the AT&T-owned POP in B to the callee. [5]

The telephony industry could quality as a natural monopoly, so I think it's worth asking whether
this was the right way to break up a company like AT&T. The breakup of AT&T into regional monopolies
probably didn't exactly solve the monopoly issue or for other telephony businesses, LEC or IXC. 

One analyst [6] thinks that the lower prices following the breakup of AT&T is solely attributed to
one factor:

> "But on closer examination, the rise in competition and lower long-distance prices are
> attributable to just one aspect of the 1982 decree; specifically, a requirement that the Bell
> companies modify their switching facilities to provide equal access to all long-distance
> carriers."

In other words, the breakup of the monopoly opened the playing field for the burgeoning
telecommunications industry to unpreferentially build on top of the infrastructure created by AT&T's
nationwide network. It's likely the Internet, which was initially piggybacked off of dial-up, may
have developed to be less equalizing without this clause.

> "The technological revolution spurred by the transition from wireline telephone service to
> wireless telephone service shook up the telecommunications industry in the 1990s. The rapid
> change caught even some of the smartest players by surprise. In 1980, the management consulting
> firm McKinsey and Co. produced a report for AT&T predicting how large the cellular market might
> become by the year 2000. Their forecast said that 900,000 cell phones would be in use. The
> actual number was more than 109 million."

A similar fate for the tech giants today would be a future that could be what we need. One
thread that separates the tech giants from other successful tech companies is that they've created
ecosystems and platforms for other businesses to flourish off of. Third party merchants (Amazon),
App developers (App and Play Store), Software companies (AWS and Google Cloud), Content creators
(Facebook, Instagram, Youtube), Media and Journalism (Google Search, Facebook), etc. Other product
offerings (e.g. Chrome, Kindle, Oculus) don't evoke the same monopolistic fears, not until web
standards or eBook markets become defined by the ecosystems they create. I think it makes the most
sense to split large tech companies along these lines, although how to do it is another entirely
separate question.

### United States v. Microsoft

Couldn't make the time for this.

I'm volunteering myself to help out with things like:
 * Setting smaller draft deadlines and goals
 * Peer editing and comments if that's helpful
 * Discussing for inspiration

Ideally writing should be a fun and enlightening experience for us all, so doing anything to make it
